* Version: 0.8.10
* Release date: 18/07/2018
* Author: Thomas 'XtremeXp/WinterIsComing' P.

# Description

UT4 Converter helps converting maps from Unreal (Tournament) previous games
to Unreal Tournament 4.
---


# UT games supported
* Unreal 1
* Unreal 2
* Unreal Tournament (1999)
* Unreal Tournament 2003/2004
* Unreal Tournament 3
* UDK

Event if all unreal games are supported, since program is in early stages,
conversion quality for unreal tournament 2003/2004 and unreal tournament 3
might be pretty bad.

If you want to convert UT games to Unreal Tournament 3,
download and use UT3 Converter program instead of UT4 Converter.

# What is converted
Here is the conversion table for all ut games about what the program can convert.

|                | Brushes | Lightning | Sounds | Textures | Meshes | StaticMeshes | Terrain    | Base Pickups | Overall |
|----------------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|------------|:------------:|:-------:|
| Unreal 1       |    ++   |     ++    |   ++   |    ++    |   No   |      N/A     |     N/A    |      ++      |   GOOD  |
| Unreal 2       |    ++   |     ++    |   ++   |     +    |   N/A  |       +      |      No    |       -      |  MEDIUM |
| UT99           |    ++   |     ++    |   ++   |    ++    |   No   |      N/A     |     N/A    |      ++      |   GOOD  |
| UT2003/ UT2004 |    ++   |     ++    |   ++   |     +    |   N/A  |      ++      |Yes(partial)|       +      |   GOOD  |
| UT3            |    ++   |     +     |    +   |     +    |   N/A  |       +      |      No    |       +      |  MEDIUM |


# What is NOT converted
* Models
* Terrain (UT2004 has partial support only)
* Music (Unreal Tournament 3 only)
* All custom things (scripts and pickups)

Note: staticmesh conversion is not fully automatic.
You need to convert them manually using Blender software.
Converter will do the job to get the right references and textures applied.

# Requirements
* Windows 7/8/10 - 64 Bit Operating System
* Java 8 - https://www.java.com/fr/download/ (not yet compatible with Java 9+)
* Unreal Tournament 4 (2015) Editor
* One of the following previous UT games:
  ° Unreal 1
  ° Unreal 2
  ° Unreal Tournament
  ° Unreal Tournament 2003
  ° Unreal Tournament 2004
  ° Unreal Tournament 3
* NConvert texture conversion program: http://www.xnview.com/en/nconvert/
* UModel Unreal resource program extractor: http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel

Installation and first start
------------------------------
* Install nconvert http://www.xnview.com/en/nconvert/
* Install umodel http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel
* Decompress the ZIP archive to any folder of your choice.
* Double-click on UT4-Converter-<version>.jar, the program should be launching.

If not, make sure you have installed latest Java technology version at www.java.com
and create some "run.bat" batch file with notepad that you will save in the
program folder with this command line:
"java -jar UT4-Converter-<version>.jar" (will force launching this file associating it
as java program)
Go to Settings and set the unreal games folders as well as umodel and nconvert program paths


Detailed explanations about conversion is always displayed after each end of map conversion
in program.

# How to convert map?

Make sure you are allowed to convert the original map (if you are not the original author for example)

For UT3/UDK maps only:
- Open a text editor (notepad for example)
- Open map with the UT3 or UDK editor.
- In menu go to "Edit" -> "Select all"
- Copy all data stuff ("Edit" -> "Copy" or Ctrl+C)
- Paste data in your text editor and save your file with a .t3d file extension

Note: this .t3d file is needed because the "ut3/udk.com batchexport" command to export
.ut3 level to .t3d file messes up the brush order unlike the copy/paste from editor.

---
# In UT4 Converter:
- Launch UT4 Converter
- Go to "Convert -> <Unreal Tournament X/Unreal X> Map"
- In the conversion settings, press "Select" and choose the map
- for ut3 only: select the .t3d file you previously created manually (see For UT3 maps only section)
- Press ok and wait while the conversion is running (it might takes several minutes)

# In UT4 Editor:
- Open the UT4 Editor
- Create new level ("File -> New level ...") and select "Empty level"

- Import sounds
-- Browse to /Maps/WIP/<MapName>-UT99/U1 path using the internal browser
-- Click on "Import" and select converted sound files from <UT4ConverterPath>/Converted/<MapName>/Sounds
-- After import, right click on all sounds imported in editor and choose "create cue"
-- Make sounds loop if needed (double click on it and set "looping" to true). Generally sounds with name containing "loop" word are loop sounds
(e.g:  "AmbOutside_Looping_waves4")

- Import Textures
-- Browse to /Maps/WIP/<MapName>-UT99/U1 path using the internal browser
-- Click on "Import" and select converted sound files from <UT4ConverterPath>/Converted/<MapName>/Textures
-- After import, right click on all texture in editor and choose "create material"

- Import StaticMeshes
-- Browse to /Maps/WIP/<MapName>-UT99/U1 path using the internal browser
-- Click on "Import" and select converted staticmeshes .obj files from <UT4ConverterPath>/Converted/<MapName>/StaticMeshes

- Import converted map
-- Open the file <UT4ConverterPath>/Converted/<MapName>/<MapName>-<X>.t3d with an advanced text editor (like notepad++)
-- Select all text (Ctrl+A) and copy(Ctrl+C)/paste(Ctrl+V) it into the editor
- Rebuid Geometry ("Build" -> "Build Geometry")


Note:
- If after conversion your map got some bsp holes, remove all
"sheet" brushes (e.g: flat lava/water surface, they are generally colored in "green" color in UT/U1 editor).
 The converter does remove most of them, but not all of them yet.

---
# Limitations / Issues / Troubleshooting
- [UT99] Some textures may not be correctly aligned
- Flag bases/Teleporters do not import correctly if you do not have loaded previously a map
containing these actors (UE4-side bug)
- Level may appear too dark sometimes. In this case add a "PostProcessVolume", "Unbound" it
and set a cube ambient map texture.
- Extraction of sound resources only works with Windows
- Movers are replaced with lift actor which may not suit for all kind of movers (such as doors, switches, ...)
You may use the "Door" actor or "Matinee" actor (not auto-converted yet)
- Since Unreal Engine 4 does not support sheet brushes (e.g: flat lava/water surface, ...) , and as the converter
does not remove all of them, some "bsp holes" may appear (in that case try to find out all these brushes
and remove them until bsp holes disapear)
