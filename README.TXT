Decompress the ZIP archive to any folder of your choice.
Double-click on UT4-Converter-0.1.0.jar, the program should be launching.

If not, make sure you have installed latest Java tecknology version at www.java.com
and create some "run.bat" batch file with notepad that you will save in the 
program folder with this commande line:
"java -jar UT4-Converter-0.1.0.jar" (will force launching this file associating it 
as java program)

How to convert map?
------------------------------
Make sure you are allowed to convert the original map (if you are not the original author for example)

In UT99 Editor:
X) Open the Unreal Tournament (1999) Editor
X) Open the map you want to convert 
(note if it does not seems to load (on Windows Vista/7/8/+), copy map to some folder without spaces and re-open)
X) Export and save map to Unreal Text map using menu "File -> Export"

In UT4 Converter:
X) Launch UT4 Converter
X) Go to "Convert -> UT99 Map"
X) Select the .t3d map file you have just saved before and press OK.

In UT4 Editor:
X) Open the UT4 Editor
X) Create new level ("File -> New level ...") and select "Empty level"
X) Create an additive brush to simulate subtractive level: (Unreal Engine 4 does not support levels in "Subtract" mode)
-- Go to "Modes" panel (left top of screen)
-- Go to "BSP"
-- Drag and drop a "Box" in the map
X) Import converted map
-- "File -> Import ..."
-- Select the file and click on OK to import the map
X) Rebuid Geometry ("Build" -> "Build Geometry")
X) Re-size the additive brush so the entire level fits in the brush

Optional:
Select all surfaces of the brush in additive mode added (select one surface + press "Ctrl+B"
Change "LightMap Resolution" from 32 to 1024.
This will save a lot of filesize space for the map ! (and outside of that brush is never displayed to player)

Note:
For some maps you may have to use subtractive brushes before importing level.
This depends mainly on layout of map (outdoor map such as CTF-Face and so on ...)
